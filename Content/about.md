Hey, welcome to my blog! I've been doing software development since 2015, most of it on the iOS platform. Throughout this time I worked as a solo developer, with small and large teams as well as taught iOS development in a coding academy.

When working on my own I got the experience of communicating with clients face to face, formulating requirements, making designs, and eventually releasing applications. The work in larger organizations taught me the importance of clear communication both in real-life and in code. I developed in large and fast-growing codebases that required rethinking, coordination, refactoring, and automation efforts to make them suitable for the work of multiple teams. 

I intend to use this blog as a way to share my learnings, my projects or just to fulfill random bursts of creativity. 

Feel free to contact me on Twitter, LinkedIn or simply write me an email!
