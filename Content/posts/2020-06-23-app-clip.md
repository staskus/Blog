excerpt: iOS 14 introduces App Clips that allows making some of our app’s functionality available to users who don’t have the full app installed. In this article we take a first glance at this new feature.

During [WWDC20](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/) Apple is introducing new [App Clips](https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/) feature. As it's described in the landing page:

> An app clip is a small part of your app that’s discoverable at the moment it’s needed.

Apple already suggested some possible use cases such as ordering from a take-out restaurant or renting a scooter. And App Clips will be discovered and invoked by using new App Clip Codes, NFC Tags, QR Codes, Messages, or as place cards in Maps.

It looks like a great move forward in reducing friction and getting an app into users' hands as fast as possible.

We'll take a look at the initial steps of how these App Clips could be implemented and introduced in the project.

## Prerequisites

Xcode 12 or higher.

## Getting Started

We start by creating a new project and selecting the creation of a new target.

We select a new App Clip target and add it to our application.

<img src="/images/app-clip/new_target_app_clip.png" alt="App Clip New Target" width="600"/>

## Add Associated Domain

We need to provide an associated domain for both App and App Clip targets. If App is not installed the link will open App Clip. Otherwise full App will be opened instead.

We do it by selecting _Target -> Signing & Capabilities_, clicking + sign, and choosing Associated Domains.

<img src="/images/app-clip/associated_domains.png" alt="Creating Associated Domain" width="600"/>

Next, we enter our associated domain value which must follow pattern of _appclips:domain_. In this instance, we can enter _appclips:example.com_.

## Running App Clip target

App Clip target can be run and debugged just like an App target.

We can open `ContentView.swift` inside an App Clip target, make changes, and run.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, App Clip!").padding()
    }
}
```

<img src="/images/app-clip/hello_app_clip.png" alt="Hello App Clip Simulator Screen" width="300"/>

## Configuring App Clip

App Clip is invoked via URL which can contain context-related information and be used in the configuration.

Let's say we want to provide a user with a more personalized greeting message after App Clip was invoked. We can pass binding `name` variable to `ContentView`.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @Binding var name: String

    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, \(name)").padding()
    }
}
```

This example uses a new App lifecycle in SwiftUI which enables entire apps to be written completely in SwiftUI.

Information about invocation is passed through lifecycle events. We can use `onContinueUserActivity` to be notified about App Clip being launched with parameters.

More information about using legacy lifecycles can be found on [Access the Invocation URL section](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/responding_to_invocations).

After that, we take the incoming URL and its first path component. Now first path parameter passed through URL will be set as a name.

```swift
@main
struct AppClipSneakPeekClipApp: App {
    @State var name = ""

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView(name: $name).onContinueUserActivity(NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb, perform: respondTo)
        }
    }

    func respondTo(_ activity: NSUserActivity?) {
        guard let name = firstParameterValue(from: activity) else { return }

        self.name = name
    }

    private func firstParameterValue(from activity: NSUserActivity?) -> String? {
        // Parsing components from URL
        guard let activity = activity else { return nil }
        guard let incomingURL = activity.webpageURL else { return nil }
        guard let components = NSURLComponents(url: incomingURL, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: true) else { return nil }

        // Taking first parameter: example.com/?parameter=Lisa
        return components.queryItems?.first?.value
    }
}
```

## Testing

Launching AppClip target now does not show any name value. It makes sense as we didn't pass any URL with parameters to our app.

We can automatically test it by providing _Environment Variable_ for App Clip scheme. It can be done by selecting `App Clip scheme -> Edit Scheme -> Run` and set the value of _\_XCAppClipURL_ of test URL value. We set it to _https://example.com/?parameter=Lisa_ to have a first parameter value.

If we launch the application now, the value is received through lifecycle event and updated inside a view.

### What about App Clip Card?

App Clip Card itself that is shown with a suggestion to open an App Card is not developed through Xcode. The information displayed in this card can be configured through [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/login). Developers will be able to change a header image, subtitle, and title on the action button.

## Where do we go from here?

App Clip looks like a promising addition to the ecosystem and it will be interesting to see how it will be used and adopted by both developers and users.

The example project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/staskus/AppClipSneakPeekApp).
