excerpt: Swift community is growing and so is the variety of tools that are being created. In this blog article we'll go through the creation of a blog using a static site generator Publish.

[Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) is a static site generator built for Swift developers. We'll be migrating a static blog generation from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to Publish. The previous version of a blog was generated using Jekyll and a provided theme without putting too much effort in understanding the whole creation process. This time I decided to dig deeper into understanding Publish and remembering long forgotten *HTML* and *CSS* skills.

We'll be trying to create a similar style blog that was created using Jekyll. It should remain adaptable for bigger or smaller screen sizes:

# Getting Started
After running the steps described in a [Publish repository](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) we end up with a sample project that showcases the main parts and features of Publish.

In the folder structure we can see `posts` folder that contains an example post. I copy-pasted my blog posts `.md` files from old Jekyll blog to see if it works. We only need to change couple fields to make it work. The only difference is a metadata format on top of `.md` file. By removing quotes from strings, brackets from arrays and renaming categories to tags we can get Jekyll articles immediately generated into a new blog.

# Website

If we open up `main.swift` file we see:

```swift
try Blog().publish(withTheme: .foundation)
```

In Publish a website is a simple Swift struct that should contain mandatory fields required by a `Website` protocol as well as any additional fields that might be needed. 

As this blog contains personal information as well as links to social media accounts, I included them in a `Blog` structure.


```swift
struct Blog: Website {
    enum SectionID: String, WebsiteSectionID {
        case posts
        case about
    }

    struct ItemMetadata: WebsiteItemMetadata {
    	// Additional field in post .md metadata
        var excerpt: String
    }

    var url = URL(string: "https://www.staskus.io")!
    var title = "staskus.io"
    var name = "Povilas Staškus"
    var description = "iOS Developer"
    var language: Language { .english }
    var imagePath: Path? { nil }
    var socialMediaLinks: [SocialMediaLink] { [.location, .email, .linkedIn, .github, .twitter] }
}
```

# Theme

Basic `foundation` theme is used after generating a website for the first time. However, it's only there to give an example of how custom site theme should be created.

A `Theme` is built by conforming to `HTMLFactory` protocol.

Not all the pages are needed to be created for your site to be fully functioning. For a blog we must have: 1) an index page, that shows header, sidebar and list of posts. 2) item page, that will show full post.

```swift
class BlogHTMLFactory: HTMLFactory {

    func makeIndexHTML(for index: Index,
                       context: PublishingContext<Blog>) throws -> HTML {
    	// Returning HTML of an Index Page
    }

    func makeSectionHTML(for section: Section<Site>,
                         context: PublishingContext<Blog>) throws -> HTML {
    	// Returning HTML of a Section Index Page that displays section items
    }

    func makeItemHTML(for item: Item<Site>,
                      context: PublishingContext<Blog>) throws -> HTML {
    	// Returning HTML of a Post Page
    }

    func makePageHTML(for page: Page,
                      context: PublishingContext<Blog>) throws -> HTML {
    	// Returning HTML of a Section Page 
    }

    func makeTagListHTML(for page: TagListPage,
                         context: PublishingContext<Blog>) throws -> HTML? {
    	// Returning HTML of a Page with list of available tags
    }

    func makeTagDetailsHTML(for page: TagDetailsPage,
                            context: PublishingContext<Blog>) throws -> HTML? {
    	// Returning HTML of a Page for a specific tag
    }
}
```

Although we can write `HTML` code using Swift, the styling of the site is done using `CSS.` For the creation of this blog, I decided to use [Pure.css](https://purecss.io). The desired blog theme is quite minimalist and the features that [Pure.css](https://purecss.io) provides seem more than enough to achieve what we want. Even after many years without any `CSS` and `HTML` experience it was possible to make pretty decent layout. For the rest of this article, we won't be focusing on that. The code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/nitesuit/Blog) for those who are interested.

## Index Page

`makeIndexHTML` builds HTML of an index page. The structure is the same as writing plain HTML tags. We set *language*, *head* and then structure layout inside *body*.

Body uses `.grid` node that creates Pure.css grid in which we can structure our layout. We have `.header`, `.sidebar`, `.posts` and `.footer` that are put one after the other. 

```swift
class BlogHTMLFactory: HTMLFactory {

    func makeIndexHTML(for index: Index,
                       context: PublishingContext<Blog>) throws -> HTML {
    	HTML(
            .lang(context.site.language),
            .head(for: context.site),
            .body(
                .grid(
                    .header(for: context.site),
                    .sidebar(for: context.site),
                    .posts(
                        for: context.allItems(
                            sortedBy: \.date,
                            order: .descending
                        ),
                        on: context.site,
                        title: "Recent posts"
                    ),
                    .footer(for: context.site)
                )
            )
        )
    }
}
```
Any node can be written as a `static` func extension of a `Node`. `Context == HTML.BodyContext` indicate that this node can be only used inside *body*. It's a nice and clean way to declare new nodes, as they can be then used using dot syntax.

```swift
extension Node where Context == HTML.BodyContext {
    static func grid(_ nodes: Node...) -> Node {
        .div(
            .id("layout"),
            .class("pure-g"),
            .group(nodes)
        )
    }
}
```

## Post

A post can be declared the same way as any other node. On the top, we show the title of the post. Below, we show date. We can use any powerful features that Swift infrastructure provides us. In this instance, we use `DateFormatter` to format a date. In a similar way any more complex or sophisticated logic could be used inside this code. 

```swift
extension Node where Context == HTML.BodyContext {
    static func post(for item: Item<Blog>, on site: Blog) -> Node {
        return .pageContent(
            .h2(
                .class("post-title"),
                .a(
                    .href(item.path),
                    .text(item.title)
                )
            ),
            .p(
                .class("post-meta"),
                .text(DateFormatter.blog.string(from: item.date))
            ),
            .tagList(for: item, on: site),
            .div(
                .class("post-description"),
                .div(
                    .contentBody(item.body)
                )
            )
        )
    }
}
```

## Finishing the theme

We can make our theme accessible by creating `Theme` object and passing our `BlogHTMLFactory`. Declaring it as a *static var* inside an extension allows reaching it more conveniently.

```swift
extension Theme where Site == Blog {
    static var blog: Self {
        Theme(htmlFactory: BlogHTMLFactory())
    }
}
```



# Generating the site

We've seen how by creating nodes we can step by step create pages for our blog. However, I would argue that the biggest power of Publish comes from `plugins` and additional building steps that we can create or use.

[Splash](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Splash) is a Swift syntax highlighter for blogs that has a plugin built for Publish. During the blog generation process, this plugin uses markdown parser to identify code inside `.md` files and apply syntax highlighting. 

We can use or build any steps that might do additional checks, append necessary information or simply tweak a site in any way needed. 

```swift
import SplashPublishPlugin

try Blog().publish(
    withTheme: .blog,
    additionalSteps: [.deploy(using: .gitHub("nitesuit/nitesuit.github.io"))],
    plugins: [.splash(withClassPrefix: "")]
)
```

# Result

Publish worked seamlessly during development process. It provided all the convenience of Swift strong type system and helped stay focused while trying to figure unfamiliar web development workflows. Although Publish still misses many features that established static site generators have, it serves perfectly for its intended audience - Swift developers.   Now that all the parts of the site are well understood, Publish together with Swift gives a lot of power for future improvements.
