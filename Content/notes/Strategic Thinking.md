*"Strategic thinking is the ability to think on a big and small scale, long and short term, and into the past and the present. While strategic thinking is a valuable skill for everyone in an organization, it becomes increasingly essential as you ascend the ladder."*

### Great vs average strategic thinker

The difference is the ability to do that under pressure. Train yourself and your team to pause at the righr moments.

## 5 strategic checks

### Gap Check

“What’s the gap between the current state and desired state? How can we make it measurable?” 

### Lens Check

 Pick a problem or recurring tension and evaluate it via the 3 Lenses Model by asking, “What other factors may be contributing to this?”

### Link Up Check

Pick any task you or your team are working on and link it up to the end game. Ask: “What does this link up to?” Double check for alignment, effectiveness, and increase motivation by understanding how daily work connects to the big picture. 

### UC Check

Great strategic thinkers think long-term. Help yourself and others do this by asking, “What unintended consequences do we need to look out for?” and “What might cause this plan to fail?” 

### Inclusive Planning Check

Take time to map out a project and make sure you are including the right people at the right time.
