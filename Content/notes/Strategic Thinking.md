*"Strategic thinking is the ability to think on a big and small scale, long and short term, and into the past and the present. While strategic thinking is a valuable skill for everyone in an organization, it becomes increasingly essential as you ascend the ladder."*

### Great vs average strategic thinker

The difference is the ability to do that under pressure. Train yourself and your team to pause at the righr moments.

## 5 strategic checks

### Gap Check

Put numbers on it (current vs goal).

“What’s the gap between the current state and desired state? How can we make it measurable?” 

Gap analysis in strategic thinking involves evaluating the current state of a situation against a desired future state to identify discrepancies or "gaps." This allows organizations to focus their resources on bridging these gaps through targeted actions.

**Lead Indicators**: Predict future outcomes. E.g., customer inquiries can indicate future sales.

LEADING INDICATOR QUESTIONS
* What processes can I employ to achieve this goal to higher levels of success?
* What skills can the team improve to better achieve the desired outcome?
* What steps can be taken to speed up product development or process improvement?

**Lag Indicators:** Measure past performance. E.g., quarterly revenue reflects past actions.

### Lens Check

Diagnose using the 3 Lenses Model.

A "lens check" usually refers to examining a situation, strategy, or issue from various perspectives to gain a comprehensive understanding. The term can be metaphorical, representing different viewpoints like financial, ethical, or customer-focused lenses.

Lens check is helpful for giving feedback.

#### 3 Lenses Model

For example, there's an issue in filling a role in a company.

- Person issue, is it skill or will issue?
- Manager issue, expectation, feedback, accountability issue?
- Organizational issue, is it a value, role models, systems, constraints issue?

### Link Up Check

Confirm alignment and effectiveness.

Pick any task you or your team are working on and link it up to the end game. Ask: “What does this link up to?” Double check for alignment, effectiveness, and increase motivation by understanding how daily work connects to the big picture. 

- What is the ultimate goal / link-up?
- What is the overall strategy for achieving it?
- What is an important tactic we'll use?

Our overall strategy to increase revenue, is to first get as many quick-wins as possible.
We're going to reuse the flows that web developers already made from within the app, rather than rebuilding.

### UC (Unintended consequences) Check

Mitigate unintended consequences.

Deliberate risk management.

Great strategic thinkers think long-term. Help yourself and others do this by asking, “What unintended consequences do we need to look out for?” and “What might cause this plan to fail?” 

Pre-mortem:
- What might cause this project to fail?

### Inclusive Planning Check

Involve right people at the right time.

Biggest predictor of strategic failure? Not involving right people at the right time.

Take time to map out a project and make sure you are including the right people at the right time.
