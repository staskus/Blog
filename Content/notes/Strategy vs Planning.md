## Strategy

Strategy is an integrative set of choices that positions you on a playing field of your choice in a way that you win.

Strategy answers why we are on this particular playing field, and how on that playing field we're going to be better than anyone else. A strategic theory mus be coherent and doable.

- Actual customers are your customers
- You don't control customers
- You don't control revenues
- Uncertain, uncomfortable

## Planning

Planning is the process of thinking regarding the activities required to achieve a desired goal.

- You control costs
- You are the customer
- Comfortable

## Example

While all the established airlines are busy **planning** their routes, the new upcoming airlines create a **strategy** to disrupt the market by having only shorthaul flights, use the same aircraft for all the routes, and optimize costs, eventually becoming a number one airline.

## Planning trap

Planning can be a comfortable excercise were you can lay down all the steps and predict the outcomes. However, it may not help make significant improvements or change. 

Strategy requires to take risks and accept uncertainty. *If our theory is right about what we can do, and how the market will react, will position ourselves in a great way*. When strategizing, lay down the logic what assumptions need to be true in order for the strategy to work. Observe if those assumptions are true, and if they are not, tweak the strategy. 

Keep the strategy short and clear.
