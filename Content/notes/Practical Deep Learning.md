To do image recognition before neural networks there was a lot of manual work involved by doing feature engineering. Neural networks are able to learn features automatically. For example, features that recognize corners, or features that recognize gradients. Going deeper into the layers, features become more complex and sophisticated. You start with a random neural network, feed it examples, and it will create features by itself.

| Myth | Truth |
|----------|----------|
| Lots of math | High school math is sufficient |
| Lots of data | Sometimes <50 items of data is enough to get record-breaking results |
| Lots of expensive computers | Usually you get what you need on laptop |

### Tools

[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is community platform for data scientists. In the scope of the course, it is used to share notebooks. [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is a notebook interface used for the service.
