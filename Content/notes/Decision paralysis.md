title: Decision Paralysis
excerpt: Project Management
---

Decision paralys can be cause by mulitple factors:
1. Pefect solution is favored over shipping and learning
2. No agreed directly responsible individual who can break ties
3. No one wants to say no and stay polite
4. People with different levels of experise get the same voice
5. The goals are not clear
6. Bikeshedding (the tendency to spend a lot of time on trivial details)

## Solutions

### Define the decision process beforehand

1. What is the goal?
2. Who makes the decision?
3. When do we want to make a decision?
4. Consensus vs consent

### Identify the leader

Depending on the decision, some are harder to make than others, require taking responsibility or deep experise. Anticipate decision paralysis and identify the leader beforehand.
