title: Adaptivity and Resilience
excerpt: Soft Skills
---

## Awareness

We need to learn of our `style under stress`, and know the default coping style:

### For example

- Freeze: slow/stall
- Fight: aggressive problem-solve, debate
- Rabbit holing: dig deep on one topic
- Spin: jump from topic to topic, distract
- Robot-mode: show no emotions
- Helper-mode: give advice

When we notice someones default coping style, we can help them by noticing people mentioning or doing these things, and offering help or asking how they are doing. "Don' take a bait and make it worse". See through: Don't take others' response personally. "Oh, That's them coping!"

## Individual level response

### Regain homeostaic balance

Homeostasis is the tendency to maintain a stable, relatively constant internal environment

- Animals shake it out
- Humans breathe, stretch, move

People who have patterns of resilience understand when the situation need to be changed: when they need to breathe, stretch, go grab a water.

#### Deliberate pauses

- Micro: Stretches between meeetings
- Meso: Lunch breaks and constant sleeping time
- Macro: Vacations


### De-fuse

Brain is a problem-finding machine. If we just let it run, it will find constant stream of problems. Just aknowledge the thoughts and let them go.

To defuse, prefix the worriyng thoughts with: "My brain is having the thought that...". You can look deeper what these worries are trying to tell you and what needs are behind them.

### Do a two-hander

Goal: Organize the thinking

- Can't control, can control
- Won't focus on, will focus on
- What I don't know, do know

### Articulate the positive

It's helpful just to think about any positive things that happened recently. Ask yourself "What am I grateful for?", "What can I learn from this?"


## Team level response

### Invite cognitive offload

#### Small talk questions

- How are you feeling today?
- How has you week been going?
- What's been you highlight this week? What made it a highlight?

#### Playback

- Am I right in hearing you say?
- I'm wondering if you are feeling frustrated / worried / confused?
- Ok, you're wanting certainty / closure/ clarity? Is that right?


### Reset questions

Reset questions help when there's a feeling of being stuck:

Observation statement: I feel we're spinning a bit.
Reset: How about we pause and do a quick reset...
Ask questions:
- What's the most important thing?
- What is our decision criteria?
- What's another angle?
- What's important to you about this?
- What's the first smallest step to take?
- How can I help?
- Should we take a break?

### Scenario planning

Use the term `Let's create scenarios`. Creatre 2-3 scenarios of what could happen about the things we're anxious about, add likelihood, impact, readiness, comfort level.

### Celebrate adaptivity

Discuss: Where are you/your team already good at celebrating adaptivity? What opportunities do you have to do this more? How do you want to celebrate adaptivity moving forward?
