## Problems

### Are you solving the right problem?

This is a complex problem that requires a lot of research and thinking. You need to understand the problem and the context in which it occurs.


Usually it's a combination of customer research ([product discovery](https://href.li/?https://www.productplan.com/glossary/product-discovery/)) and iterative design and engineering processes. Some of the well known approaches including over a dozen user [research methods](https://href.li/?https://www.toptal.com/designers/user-research/guide-to-ux-research-methods), [design sprints](https://href.li/?https://www.gv.com/sprint/), [design thinking](https://href.li/?https://designthinking.ideo.com/), and etc.

It's important to understand that any of these methods take time, skill and offer guidance, not a clear answer. You need to be able to make decisions and take risks. The goal is to raise probability of success, not to guarantee it.
