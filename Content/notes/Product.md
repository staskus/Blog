### Product management

Product management is at its core the process of thinking about how the whole product fits together for customers and business.

#### Four connective skills of product managers

When you are a product manager, you need to be able to excel at four connective skills, otherwise the projects can get in trouble.

- Communicate effectively within the team and with stakeholders
- Organize the product team
- Research the market
- Execute and lead daily work

### Problems

#### Are you solving the right problem?

This is a complex problem that requires a lot of research and thinking. You need to understand the problem and the context in which it occurs.

Usually it's a combination of customer research ([product discovery](https://href.li/?https://www.productplan.com/glossary/product-discovery/)) and iterative design and engineering processes. Some of the well known approaches including over a dozen user [research methods](https://href.li/?https://www.toptal.com/designers/user-research/guide-to-ux-research-methods), [design sprints](https://href.li/?https://www.gv.com/sprint/), [design thinking](https://href.li/?https://designthinking.ideo.com/), and etc.

It's important to understand that any of these methods take time, skill and offer guidance, not a clear answer. You need to be able to make decisions and take risks. The goal is to raise probability of success, not to guarantee it.

### Prioritization

One needs to be careful when respoding to user feature requests and have in mind that only the people who are capable of reaching out to you are making requests. There're segments of people who cannot or won't make feature requests and we need to understand which users are not well represented.

Use feature requests to investigate gaps in the product. Do not act on them directly. Use methods such as [5 whys method](https://href.li/?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys) to truly understand the issue.

> People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole.

#### Formula

Before starting the work on any feature request, make sure you can formulate this sentence:

> If we **add feature X** it **solves problem Y** for **customer group Z** which helps with **roadmap goal V** by **increasing value by Q**.
