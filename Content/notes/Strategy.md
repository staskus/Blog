## A problem-solving flow

1. Listen and clarify the question. Write down the important bits of information.
2. Go through the examples and create your own example. Draw if possible.
3. State a brute-force solution and its time & space complexities
4. Optimize
   1. Look for bottlenecks, unnecessary work, and duplicated work
   2. Maybe there are unused bits of information from the description?
   3. Try going through the solution with different examples
   4. Try to solve with simplest example and make it bit by bit more complex
   5. Make time vs space tradeoff
   6. Computing some values (like sorting) upfront
   7. Brainstorm all the possible data structures
   8. Think about the best possible runtime and then how to achieve it
5. Walkthrough the approach in detail
6. Implement keeping coding standards in mind
7. Test
   1. Code review
   2. Small test cases
   3. Special cases and edge cases
