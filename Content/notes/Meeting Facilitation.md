title: Meeting Facilitation
excerpt: Project Management
---

"A facilitator is an individual who uses self-awareness, self-management, group awareness, and group process to enable teams to access their collective intelligence in order to achieve their desired outcomes." - Marsha Acker

In a nutshell, a facilitator is a person who helps a group to achieve its goals. The facilitator is not a leader, but a guide. At the same time, facilitator is juggling between:

- Results: accomplishment of the group's goals
- People: needs of the group members
- Process: methods or approach for doing the work

## Facilitation Loop

- Preparation (spend the same time as the length of the meeting)
- Open the session
- Doing the work
- Close the session (bring clarity, conclusion, and next steps)
- Follow up

### Open the session

Human beings respond to the context in which they are in. If you put people in the boxing ring, they probably going to box.

- We’re here to figure out how on earth this happened and make sure it never happens again.
- We’re here to better understand the situation and put in place measures to prevent its likelihood in future.
- Today I invite you to put on your adventurer’s hat as we’ll be going on a journey, looking back on the path we’ve walked so far and using it to prepare for what may lie ahead.

#### How do you open the session?

- Breahe out
- Choose your words intentionally POWER and prepare before the session:
  - Purpose - why does this matter?
  - Outcomes - what are we trying to achieve?
  - What's in it for me
  - Expectations - what can people expect from the session?
  - Roles and responsibilities - are there any roles to clarify?
- Checkin
- Agreements
