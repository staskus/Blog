title: Meeting Facilitation
excerpt: Project Management
---

"A facilitator is an individual who uses self-awareness, self-management, group awareness, and group process to enable teams to access their collective intelligence in order to achieve their desired outcomes." - Marsha Acker

In a nutshell, a facilitator is a person who helps a group to achieve its goals. The facilitator is not a leader, but a guide. At the same time, facilitator is juggling between:

- Results: accomplishment of the group's goals
- People: needs of the group members
- Process: methods or approach for doing the work

## Facilitation Loop

- Preparation (spend the same time as the length of the meeting)
- Open the session
- Doing the work
- Close the session (bring clarity, conclusion, and next steps)
- Follow up

### Open the session

Human beings respond to the context in which they are in. If you put people in the boxing ring, they probably going to box.

- We’re here to figure out how on earth this happened and make sure it never happens again.
- We’re here to better understand the situation and put in place measures to prevent its likelihood in future.
- Today I invite you to put on your adventurer’s hat as we’ll be going on a journey, looking back on the path we’ve walked so far and using it to prepare for what may lie ahead.

#### How do you open the session?

- Breahe out
- Choose your words intentionally POWER and prepare before the session:
  - Purpose - why does this matter?
  - Outcomes - what are we trying to achieve?
  - What's in it for me
  - Expectations - what can people expect from the session?
  - Roles and responsibilities - are there any roles to clarify?
- Checkin
- Agreements

## Team Alignment

### Why alignment is important?

- Alignment reduces wasted effort
- Alignment helps create impact

The cost of alignment scales with number of people.

### Team chartering

The process and outcome facilitate and improve alignment.

Components of a team charter:
- Mission and objectives
- Roles and responsibilities
- Budget and resources
- Work processes
- Performance assessment
- Communication norms
- Rules and conflict resolution
- Signatures

## Psychological Safety

- Low Standards & High Psy Safety: Comfort Zone 😴
- Low Standards & Low Psy Safety: Apathy Zone 😑
- High Standards & High Psy Safety: Learnings & High Performance Zone ⭐️
- High Standards & Low Psy Safety: Anxiety Zone 😱

*From Amy Edmondson - The Fearless Organization, p. 18*

## Decision Making

### Ways to make decisions

Communicate the decision making process to the team upfront.

- Expert/autocratic 
- Consultative
- Democratic w. Veto
- Democratic
- Consensus

### Value sliders

Each team member can put themselves on the slider for:

- Fast vs Stable
- Prototype vs Reusable
- No Interface vs User Friendly
- Manual vs Automated
- Specific Product vs General

### Confidence slider

Ask how confident do you feel in the decision we reached? Allow people to put their names on the slider bertween:

- Very uncertain
- Very confident

## Group learning

> “Team learning is vital because teams, not individuals, are the fundamental learning unit in modern organizations. This is where ‘the rubber meets the road’; unless teams can learn, the organization cannot learn.” 
> - Peter M. Senge, The Fifth Discipline

### How can a team learn together?

- Lunch & Learn (one team member presents a flash talk)
- Blue sky thinking sessions (brainstorming together)
- Cohort based learning 

### How can a team improve together?

- Retro
- Feedback 
- Code reviews
- Pair programming

### How to decide facilitation approach?

- There can be a democratic approaches: Facilitating, coaching, co-creating
- There can be more autocratic approaches: Presenting, teaching, telling

To choose correctly, we can answer these questions:
- How much **TIME** does the group have available?
- How much relevant **KNOWLEDGE** do participants have
- What degree of **OWNERSHIP** of outccomes is needed?
- How **COMPLEX** is the topic?
- What is the **CULTURAL** norm in the group?
- How much do you want to contribute to the **CONTENT**?

#### What do you already know that you could use to create space for learning?

**A case study:** Team Jedi officially became a team just 1 month ago, and are still getting to know one another and understand their space. There are 6 people in the team, from quite different backgrounds and cultures. 
They have asked you to facilitate their first synchronous retrospective to reflect on their first month together and start finding ways to improve. From preparation discussions with them you learn that each person has had quite different experiences with retrospectives in the past, two people in particular had very bad experiences. However, the team is eager to give this a go.

**Set the stage:** Paste a picture of what the last month felt like for you.
**Gather data:** What did the lat month look like? 5 minutes silent writing just to add observations. Once everyone has added observations, ask them to put “positive experiences above the line” and “negative experiences” below the line. (Doing this after the initial brainstorm means that we suspend judgement a little and are likely to get more ideas). Discussion - open discussion about what people are seeing.
**Insights:** Prepare an exercise with sticky notes and voting: What do you notice? What themes do you see? What possible opportunities exist? What stands out?
**Decide what to do:** A table of High Impact / Low Impact, High Effort/Low Effort with sticky notes: What might we do differently based on the insights that emerged?
It's also possible to do a **Circle of control**. Ask people to write down what they can control and what they can't control. Then ask them to write down what they can do to improve the situation.
**Closing:** Decide what, who, and when does the top voted card from the previous slide.

### Stages of retrospective

Team members have to be in sync on what stage they are in. In one team member is in brainstorming stage, and another in planning - then it's hard to decide what to do.

- Set the stage (How can you create a learning atmosphere?) (POWER statement, Check in question, Reading/silent time)
- Gather data (Ask to suspend "conclusions" long enough to see new possibilities?)
- Generate insights (So what?) (Collective meaning making: What themes/patterns/insights do you now have access to?, Zoom out to see the patterns)
- Decide what to do (Now what?) (Of all the possible options, what is our next wisest action?)
- Close the retrospective (Walk the walk, Who, what, when, Feedback)

If the stage is not set, you get **Brownian Motion** (random movement of particles) no common focus
If the data is not gathered, everyone will be working from his/her own set of facts and opinion.
If insights are not generated, you get **habitual thinking**
If you don't decide what to do, you don't understand **what is the point?**
If you don't close the retrospective, you **lose an opportunity **to improve

### The prime directive

> Regardless of what we discover, **we** understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.
> - Norman Kerth

### Adaptive action

What? Opens your eyes to current reality, to challenge your expectations and assumptions.
So what? Invites you to make meaning in new and creative ways.
Now what? Brings you to action, even when you cannot predict or control what will happen.

And, every Now what? leads you to the next What?
It challenges your habitual ways of knowing and acting, so it requires practice. 

> “One of the most challenging things a group can learn in a dialogue is to hold the tension that arises and not react to it.  Typically, when faced with this kind of cross-current in the conversational ecology, people begin to “vote” on which person or perspective they feel is “right.” This relieves the tension for them, but, ironically, intensifies it for the rest of the group, since this reduces the space in which a new understanding can emerge.”

## Facilitating big groups

Preparation is more important than usual when facilitatign big groups.

It's a good idea to create a [Facilitation Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GO6fKUPFM_V74u_zYvRGEj7lXhQwC3acDS-9dQYld7I/edit?usp=sharing).

### Lean Coffee

Lean Coffee is a meeting format that encourages participants to drive the agenda by collaboratively deciding what topics to discuss and for how long. It is a great way to get a large group of people to focus on the topics that are most important to them.

- Everyone brings up a topic they want to discuss
- Optionally voting which topics we speak about if there're a lot of topics
- If the group is very large go into breakout rooms
- Create a table with 3 columns: To discuss, discussing, discussed
- We start discussing the topics, everyone says their opinion
- After 7 minute we vote to stay on the topic or move onto the next topic (just show thumbs up or down)

## Relience of the facilitator

By jumping into the conversation, the facilitator is risking taking away the opportunity for the group to learn from each other.

> Any long-term solution must strengthen the ability of the system to shoulder its own burdens.
> - Donella Meadows

## Open Space Techniques

Open Space meeting is a meeting format that encourages participants to drive the agenda by collaboratively deciding what topics to discuss and for how long. It is a great way to get a large group of people to focus on the topics that are most important to them.
