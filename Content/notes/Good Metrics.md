title: Metrics
excerpt: Project Management

Metrics can aid in making better decisions, but it's important to use established frameworks and be cautious. Keep in mind that metrics can only capture reality and do not explain why users behave a certain way or what actions to take.

> Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.
> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. – Goodhart’s law

If you overvalue the data you are collecting, which will tend to be the easiest, you are likely chasing false positives about what that data is or what it means.

Be data informed, where you use data to inform your thinking, rather than data-driven, where you use data without questioning it or recognizing its limitations.

Focus on the business goals, the metrics should derive from the top.

## Practical tips

- Use guardrails: business metrics designed to indirectly measure business value and provide alerts about any potentially misleading or erroneous results and analysis
- Iterate on metrics
- Making too many changes at the same time
- Using metrics that are outside of your control

As example, to lose weight focus on calories/day and workouts/week, not on weight.
